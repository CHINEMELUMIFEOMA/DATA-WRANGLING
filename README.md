# Data wrangling for WeRateDogs 
by Chinemelum Nwaeze

This project sought to wrangle(clean up tidy and quality issues) the dataset provided by the WeRateDogs platform.
Included in the processes carried out are merging,filling missing values, changing datatypes among others.
I followed a style of Defining the problem,coding the perceived solution and testing it out for ease of understanding.

## Tools used
